Alcohol and HDL Cholesterol
}
\description{
A small observational study of light daily alcohol consumption and HDL cholesterol -- so-called good cholesterol -- derived from NHANES 2013-2014
and 2015-2016.  There are 406 blocks of four individuals, making 1624 individuals in total.  Blocks were matched for age, female and education in five ordered categories.

\usage{data("aHDLt")}
\format{
  A data frame with 1624 observations on the following 14 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{SEQN}}{NHANES ID number}
    \item{\code{nh}}{NHANES 2013-2014 is 1314, and NHANES 2015-2016 is 1516}
    \item{\code{age}}{Age in years}
    \item{\code{female}}{1=female, 0=male}
    \item{\code{education}}{1 is <9th grade, 3 is high school, 5 is a BA degree}
    \item{\code{z}}{1=light almost daily alcohol, 0=little or no alcohol last year.}
    \item{\code{grp}}{Treated group and control groups.  Daily=light almost daily alcohol, Never=fewer than 12 drinks during entire life, Rarely=more than 12 drinks in life, but fewer than 12 in the past year, and never had a period of daily binge drinking, PastBinge = a past history of binge drinking on most days, but currently drinks once a week or less.  For details, see Rosenbaum (2023, Appendix).}
    \item{\code{grpL}}{Short labels for plotting formed as the first letters of grp. \code{D} < \code{N} < \code{R} < \code{B}}
    \item{\code{hdl}}{HDL cholesterol level mg/dL}
    \item{\code{mmercury}}{Methylmercury level ug/L}
    \item{\code{dentist1Y}}{1 = been to the dentist in the past year, 0 = all other categories.  Category 0 includes a very small number of people who did not know, refused to answer, or were otherwise missing.}
    \item{\code{bmi}}{BMI or body mass index.  A measure of obesity.}
    \item{\code{ibmi}}{Four standard categories of BMI.  0 is BMI<25 (normal), 1 is BMI in [25,30) (overweight), 2 is BMI in [30,35) (obese), 3 is BMI >= 35 (morbidly obese).}
    \item{\code{block}}{Block indicator, 1, 2, ..., 406.  The 1624 observations are in 406 blocks, each of size 4.}

\details{
The data are from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
For extensive details, see the data appendix in Rosenbaum (2023).

There is a debate about whether light daily alcohol consumption -- a single glass of red wine -- shortens or lengthens life.  LoConte et al. (2018) emphasize the important fact that alcohol is a carcinogen.  Suh et al. (1992) claim reduced cardiovascular mortality brought about by an increase in high density high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the so-called good cholesterol.  There is on-going debate about whether there are cardiovascular benefits, and if they exist, whether they are large enough to offset an increased risk of cancer.  This example looks at a small corner of the larger debate, namely the effect on HDL cholesterol.

The example contains several attempts to detect unmeasured confounding bias, if present.  There is a secondary outcome thought to be unaffected by alcohol consumption, namely methylmercury levels in the blood, likely an indicator of the consumption of fish, not of alcohol; see Pedersen et al. (1994) and WHO (2021).  There are also three control groups, all with little present alcohol consumption, but with different uses of alcohol in the past; see the definition of variable grp above.

The data are used as an example in Rosenbaum (2022, 2023, 2024).
